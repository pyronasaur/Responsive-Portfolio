                    <p class="info-text">Hi! My name is Nick Pyron, and I am a web developer (see? this is a web page I made!).  I have 5+ years in the private sector developing solutions for clients while operating as a consultant.  A fair number of those projects have been web applications, but many were written as plug-ins or standalone applications written in java or C#.NET.  I enjoy mobile and web development and I am here to grow my skill set as a web guy.</p>
                    <p class="info-text">I have many hobbies as I like to learn new things.  When I am not coding I like to play guitar, train my dogs (we have four), paint miniature models, and go snowboarding if I get the chance.  There isn't much chance in GA, but I like it enough to mention it.  There are plenty of other things I like to do as well, but my wife and I have an 18 month old baby in the house and she really gets around!  That takes me away from my other interests, but it is worth it.</p>
